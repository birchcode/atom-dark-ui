# RAtom Dark UI theme

Default dark RA UI theme for Atom: RAtom

This theme is the result of specifically chosen colours, spacing, to give minimal focus to the application, and maximum attention to your code.

It can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
